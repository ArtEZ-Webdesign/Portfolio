Semester 1

## Assignment

This project is intended to give you an introduction to all aspects of the field of web design and development. Over the course of the semester you will design, develop, test, and publish your portfolio, and a content management system to power it.The first half of this semester will focus on the front-end. Rather than constructing individual pages, you will use server-side programming to create data stores, and then databases for your content, and use that data to populate your website. In doing so, you will create a data structure from which a number of layouts, organizational structures, and interactions can be quickly sketched out, constructed, modified, tested, and iterated upon in the browser.By the end of the first quarter, you will have built a database-driven portfolio website. The second half of this semester will focus on the backend. You will develop a tool, a Content Management System (CMS), to manage the projects on your website. This tool will allow you to create and edit projects, upload images and videos, input meta-data, and perform any other functions required by your design.Try to think of your portfolio site as you would any other design project – make sure it is grounded in a solid concept, so that the result will be more than just a collection of images. Think about the function of a portfolio website, as opposed to for example publishing on social media. Apply the same thinking to your CMS: the way you structure and input your information can drastically alter the way it is consumed by the user of your website.
